They say failures are valuable only if you learn from them. Over the years, I've failed countless times, made many embarrassing mistakes at work, learning valuable lessons the hard way. I keep a running list of these lessons and revisit them whenever I have to take major life-decisions. This list isn't complete or absolute—it's a continuous reflection of my perspective as I navigate through life.

## Work Principles

1. Don't reinvent the wheel—build the cart instead. Leverage human or AI expertise to identify existing solutions and focus on integration.
2. Never micromanage, and never allow yourself to be micromanaged.
3. Be aware of your blind spots and hire people who complement your weaknesses.
4. People think and work differently. Create a space for them to explain their perspectives.

## Life Principles

1. Life is short; time is your most valuable currency.
2. Accept that you will have shortcomings. Take full responsibility for your actions and own the outcomes.
3. The pursuit of dreams gives life its meaning.
4. Attachment is the cause of all suffering. (See [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths))
5. Kindness costs little, yields much.
