Hi, I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for financial data. I am interested in *robustness under distribution shift*.

I completed my bachelors (Math & EECS) and MEng (EECS) from MIT, where I was advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). During that time, I developed a novel [variational pretraining framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03589) for weather time series, and a [pruning based jailbreak defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10862) for LLMs.

In between my bachelor's and master's, I spent two years as a **quant researcher** managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios and leading a team of four. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan).

Beyond work, I do have some hobbies. I cook passionately to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
