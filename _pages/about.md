Hello! My name is Adib Hasan. I am currently pursuing an MEng at MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where I have the privilege of being advised by [Dr. Mardaviz Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munzer Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). My thesis is about learning latent weather representations from small datasets using transformer models. I also work on making transformer models to be smaller and safer.

Before my MEng, I earned a bachelor's from MIT, double-majoring in Math and Computer Science. Post-graduation, I researched investment strategies for multi-million dollar crypto portfolios. You can check my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan) for details regarding my past professional experiences.

Beyond work, I lead an unremarkable life: I [cook](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/) food to delay the looming death from starvation, I enjoy the company of [dead philosophers](/reading/), and I stroke my fragile ego by lifting [extremely heavy objects](/powerlifting/).
