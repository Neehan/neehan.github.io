Hello! My name is Adib Hasan. I am currently pursuing an MEng at MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, where I have the privilege of being advised by Dr. Mardaviz Roozbehani and Prof. Munzer Dahleh. My research is about making large transformer models faster, safer, and finding new applications for them. Although to be honest, my research makes me less hopeful about mankind's future. 

Before my MEng, I earned a bachelor's from MIT, double-majoring in Math and Computer Science. Post-graduation, I researched investment strategies for multi-million dollar crypto portfolios. 

Beyond the professional side, my life is a thrilling void: I [cook](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/) food to delay the looming death from starvation, I enjoy the company of [dead philosophers](/reading/), and I compensate for my lack of personality by lifting [extremely heavy objects](/powerlifting/).
