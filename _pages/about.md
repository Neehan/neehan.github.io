I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for AI agents and optimize LLM inference for speed and scalability.

Previously, I earned my MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). My thesis focused on learning latent weather representations from small datasets using transformer-based architecturesâ€”akin to pretraining an LLM, but using weather data.

Prior to that, I completed a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science at MIT and spent two years as a quant researcher managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios.

Outside of work, I cook to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
