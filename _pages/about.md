I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for AI agents and optimize LLM inference for speed and scalability. I am interested in statistical learning theory, risk modeling, algorithm design, and hardware optimization.

I received a double major in Math and Computer Science and a master's in Computer Science from MIT, advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). My master's thesis focused on learning latent weather representations from small datasets with variational inference on transformer-based architectures. This is like training pretraining an LLM on weather data, but with variational inference to overcome small dataset problem.

In between my bachelor's and master's, I spent two years as a quant researcher managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios and leading a team of four. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan).

Outside of work, I cook to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
