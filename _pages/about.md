I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and optimize LLM inference for speed. I am interested in **statistical learning theory**, **risk modeling**, and **algorithm design**.

I completed my bachelors (Math and CS Double Major) and MEng (CS) from MIT, where I was advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). At that time, I worked on a **variational pretraining framework for transformers on weather data**, and **an attention pruning based defense mechanism for LLMs to prevent jailbreaking attacks.**

In between my bachelor's and master's, I spent two years as a **quant researcher** managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios and leading a team of four. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan).

Outside of work, I cook to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
