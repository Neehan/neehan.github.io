I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for financial data. I am interested in **alignment**, and **robustness under distribution shift**.

I completed my bachelors (Math & EECS) and MEng (EECS) from MIT, where I was advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). During that time, I developed a novel **variational pretraining framework** for weather time series, and **an attention activation pruning based jailbreak defense for LLMs.**

In between my bachelor's and master's, I spent two years as a **quant researcher** managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios and leading a team of four. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan).

Beyond work, I do have some hobbies. I cook passionately to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking a bit about long-term happiness. The [grandpa of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) said it comes from three [external](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) sources: money and power, social media followers, and chiseled abs. Unfortunately, all of them are temporary, and can be taken away at any moment. So I wonder if there’s something more permanent, a *realistic, concrete* internal source of happiness that can’t be touched. If you’ve figured that out, please share the wisdom. You can find me on LinkedIn.
