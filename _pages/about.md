I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large-scale retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and optimize LLM inference for speed. I am interested in **statistical learning theory**, **risk modeling**, and **algorithm design**.

I hold a double major in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science** and a master's in **Computer Science** from MIT, where I was advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). My MEng thesis focused on **learning latent weather representations using variational inference** -- essentially, pretraining a weather LLM but with variational approximation to overcome data scarcity.

In between my bachelor's and master's, I spent two years as a **quant researcher** managing multi-million dollar crypto portfolios and leading a team of four. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adib-hasan).

Outside of work, I cook to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
