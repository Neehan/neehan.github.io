I'm Adib Hasan, a research engineer at a stealth startup, where I build large retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and optimize LLM inference for speed and scale.

Previously, I earned my MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, advised by [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/) and [Prof. Munther Dahleh](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/munther-dahleh/). My thesis explored how to learn latent weather representations from small datasets using transformer-based architecturesâ€”think pretraining an LLM, but for weather.

Before my MEng, I completed a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science at MIT. Between my undergrad and MEng, I worked on investment strategies for multi-million dollar crypto portfolios.

Outside of work, I cook to avoid starvation ([proof](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/)), read [dead philosophers](/reading/), and lift [heavy objects](/powerlifting/) to maintain the illusion of control.
