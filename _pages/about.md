Hello! My name is Adib Hasan. I am pursuing an MEng at MIT EECS where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Mardaviz Roozbehani and Prof. Munzer Dahleh. My research is about making large transformer models smarter, faster, and safer. Although to be honest, I am not too hopeful about their future. 

Before my MEng, I earned a bachelor's from MIT, double-majoring in Math and Computer Science. Post-graduation, I researched investment strategies for multi-million dollar crypto portfolios. 

Outside of work, my life is a thrilling void. I [cook](https://www.instagram.com/le.spicemaster/) to avoid starvation. I enjoy the company of [dead philosophers](/books) and I compensate for my lack of personality by lifting [extremely heavy objects.](/powerlifting).
