Powerlifting is a sport where insecure people stroke their fragile egos by lifting weights that are clearly too heavy for them. Most powerlifters are under the impression that a three-plate bench press will earn them respect on the streets, but in reality, the general population couldn't care less.

When normal people imagine powerlifters, or any gymrats, they think of godzilla-like individuals like this man.

I want to make a distinction that this man is *not* a powerlifter. He is a **bodybuilder** -- a different breed of gymrats with acute symptoms of [Narcissistic Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) and [heart problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9781327/). It's hard to find to a good picture of a powerlifter because they only pose for their Deadlift PRs. And they [look miserable](https://fitnessvolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/powerlifting-rules.jpg).
