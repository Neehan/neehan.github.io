Powerlifting is a sport where people compete to lift insanely heavy weights. Most powerlifters are under the impression that a three-plate bench press will earn them everyone's respect, but in reality, the general population couldn't care less.

This man is not a powerlifter. He is a **bodybuilder** -- a distinct breed of gymrats with severe cases of [NPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) and [heart problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9781327/). Powerlifters [look miserable](https://fitnessvolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/powerlifting-rules.jpg) and only pose for deadlift PRs.
