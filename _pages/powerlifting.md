Powerlifting is a sport where people compete to lift insanely heavy weights. Most powerlifters are under the impression that a three-plate bench press makes them superior, but in reality, the general population couldn't care less.

This is not a powerlifter. This is a **bodybuilder** -- a distinct breed of gymrats with severe cases of [NPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) and [heart problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9781327/). 

A powerlifter would rather post a photo of their deadlift PR instead of posing like that.
